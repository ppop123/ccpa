# auth2api

[中文](./README_CN.md)

A lightweight dual-provider API proxy for Claude Code and OpenAI-compatible clients.

auth2api is intentionally small and focused:

- one Claude OAuth account at most
- one Codex login discovered from `codex.auth-file` or the local fallback `~/.codex/auth.json`
- one local or self-hosted proxy
- one simple goal: turn local Claude/Codex auth into usable API endpoints

It is still intentionally not a multi-account pool or a large routing platform. If you want a compact, understandable proxy that is easy to run and modify, auth2api is built for that use case.

## Features

- **Lightweight by design** — small codebase, single-account architecture, minimal moving parts
- **Claude + Codex** — serves Claude OAuth and local Codex auth from one process
- **OpenAI-compatible API** — supports `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, and `/v1/models`
- **Model-based routing** — `claude-*` stays on Claude, `gpt-*` / `o*` / `codex-*` route to Codex
- **Claude native passthrough** — supports `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens`
- **Claude Code friendly** — works with both `Authorization: Bearer` and `x-api-key`
- **Streaming, tools, images, and reasoning** — covers the main Claude usage patterns without a large framework
- **Provider-aware status** — Claude account health plus Codex auth status in `/admin/accounts`
- **Basic safety defaults** — timing-safe API key validation, per-IP rate limiting, localhost-only browser CORS

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- A Claude account if you want Claude models (Claude Max subscription recommended)
- A local Codex login if you want Codex models (`~/.codex/auth.json`), or the Codex CLI if you want auth2api to create one for you

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmazingAng/auth2api
cd auth2api
npm install
npm run build
```

## Quick start

1. Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml`.
2. Set at least one API key under `api-keys`.
3. Pick one or both providers:
   - Codex only: either make sure a local Codex auth file already exists, or run `node dist/index.js --login-codex`, then set `codex.models`.
   - Claude: run `node dist/index.js --login` once.
4. Start the server with `node dist/index.js`.

If you start with Codex only, Claude routes such as `/v1/messages` remain unavailable until you complete the Claude login flow.

## Login

Claude models still use auth2api's built-in OAuth login flow. Codex models can either reuse an existing local session, or trigger the official Codex CLI login from auth2api.

### Auto mode (requires local browser)

```bash
node dist/index.js --login
```

Opens a browser URL. After authorizing, the callback is handled automatically.

### Manual mode (for remote servers)

```bash
node dist/index.js --login --manual
```

Open the printed URL in your browser. After authorizing, your browser will redirect to a `localhost` URL that fails to load — copy the full URL from the address bar and paste it back into the terminal.

### Codex CLI login

```bash
node dist/index.js --login-codex
```

This runs `codex login` for you. If the Codex CLI is not installed, auth2api prints an install hint instead of failing silently.

At runtime, auth2api reads `codex.auth-file` first. If that path is missing, it falls back to `~/.codex/auth.json`.

## Starting the server

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

The server starts on `http://127.0.0.1:8317` by default. On first run, an API key is auto-generated and saved to `config.yaml`.

Generated keys use the `sk-...` format with 32 random bytes. For anything beyond throwaway local testing, set your own long random key in `config.yaml`.

The process can start with either provider:

- Claude available via `node dist/index.js --login`
- Codex available via `node dist/index.js --login-codex`, a configured `codex.auth-file`, or the fallback `~/.codex/auth.json`

If neither a Claude token nor a usable Codex configuration is available, auth2api exits at startup instead of serving partial misconfiguration.

When only one provider is available, `/admin/accounts` shows the missing side and the exact login command to enable it.

If the configured Claude account is temporarily cooled down after upstream rate limiting, auth2api now returns `429 Rate limited on the configured account` instead of a generic `503`.

## Configuration

Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and edit as needed:

```yaml
host: ""          # bind address, empty = 127.0.0.1
port: 8317

auth-dir: "~/.auth2api"   # where Claude OAuth tokens are stored

api-keys:
  - "sk-replace-with-a-long-random-key"   # clients use this to authenticate

body-limit: "200mb"       # maximum JSON request body size, useful for large-context usage

cloaking:
  mode: "auto"            # auto | always | never
  strict-mode: false
  sensitive-words: []
  cache-user-id: false

debug: "off"            # off | errors | verbose
```

Timeouts can also be configured if you run long Claude Code tasks:

```yaml
timeouts:
  messages-ms: 120000
  stream-messages-ms: 600000
  count-tokens-ms: 30000

codex:
  enabled: true
  auth-file: "~/.codex/auth.json"
  models:
    - "gpt-5.4"
    - "o3"
    - "codex-mini-latest"
```

By default, streaming upstream requests are allowed to run for 10 minutes before auth2api aborts them.

The default request body limit is `200mb`, which is more suitable for large Claude Code contexts than the previous fixed `20mb`.

Codex models exposed by `/v1/models` come from `codex.models`. Claude models are built in.

Important routing semantics:

- `codex.enabled: false` disables all Codex routing.
- `codex.models` is both the `/v1/models` output and the runtime allowlist for Codex requests.
- `codex.auth-file` is checked first; if it does not exist, auth2api also checks `~/.codex/auth.json`.
- A `gpt-*`, `o*`, or `codex-*` request for a model not listed in `codex.models` returns `400 Unsupported model`.

`debug` now supports three levels:
- `off`: no extra logs
- `errors`: log upstream/network failures and upstream error bodies
- `verbose`: include `errors` logs plus per-request method, path, status, and duration

## Usage

Use any OpenAI-compatible client pointed at `http://127.0.0.1:8317`:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}],
    "max_tokens": 1024
  }'
```

`/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/responses` route automatically by `model`:

- `claude-*` -> Claude provider
- `gpt-*`, `o*`, `codex-*` -> Codex provider

Unsupported or disallowed models return `400 Unsupported model`.

Example Codex request:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.4",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize this repo."}],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

### Available models

Claude models built into auth2api:

| Model ID | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `claude-opus-4-6` | Claude Opus 4.6 |
| `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | Claude Haiku 4.5 |
| `claude-haiku-4-5` | Alias for Claude Haiku 4.5 |

Short convenience aliases accepted by auth2api:

- `opus` -> `claude-opus-4-6`
- `sonnet` -> `claude-sonnet-4-6`
- `haiku` -> `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`

Codex models are configured explicitly in `config.yaml` under `codex.models`. Only models listed there are returned by `/v1/models` and accepted at runtime.

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI-compatible chat, routed by model |
| `POST /v1/responses` | OpenAI Responses API compatibility, routed by model |
| `POST /v1/messages` | Claude native passthrough, Claude-only |
| `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` | Claude token counting, Claude-only |
| `GET /v1/models` | List available models |
| `GET /admin/accounts` | Claude + Codex provider status (API key required) |
| `GET /health` | Health check |

## Docker

```bash
# Build
docker build -t auth2api .

# Run (mount your config and token directory)
docker run -d \
  -p 8317:8317 \
  -v ~/.auth2api:/data \
  -v ./config.yaml:/config/config.yaml \
  auth2api
```

Or with docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Container notes:

- If you want Claude login persistence in Docker, set `auth-dir: "/data"` in `config.yaml`.
- If you want Codex models in Docker, mount the host auth file to the same path configured by `codex.auth-file`, for example `-v ~/.codex/auth.json:/root/.codex/auth.json:ro`.
- If you change the in-container path, update `codex.auth-file` to match. If the configured path does not exist, auth2api falls back to `/root/.codex/auth.json` inside the container.

## Use with Claude Code

Set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to point Claude Code at auth2api:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8317 \
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<your-api-key> \
claude
```

Claude Code uses the native `/v1/messages` endpoint which auth2api passes through directly. Both `Authorization: Bearer` and `x-api-key` authentication headers are supported.

## Single-account mode

Claude token storage remains single-account mode:

- Running `--login` again refreshes the stored token for the same account.
- If a different account is already stored, auth2api refuses to overwrite it and asks you to remove the existing token first.
- If more than one token file exists in the auth directory, auth2api exits with an error until you clean up the extra files.

Codex auth is separate: auth2api only reads the local `~/.codex/auth.json` file and does not manage Codex login itself.

## Admin status

Use `/admin/accounts` with your configured API key to inspect the current account state:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8317/admin/accounts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-api-key>"
```

The response includes legacy Claude account snapshots plus separate `claude` and `codex` provider sections so you can see provider availability independently.

Useful fields:

- `claude.available`: whether a Claude account is currently usable
- `codex.available`: whether Codex auth plus model configuration is usable
- `codex.details.error`: why Codex is currently unavailable, for example missing auth file or empty model configuration

## Smoke tests

A minimal automated smoke test suite is included and uses mocked upstream responses, so it does not call the real Claude or Codex services:

```bash
npm run test:smoke
```
